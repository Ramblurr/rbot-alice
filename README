alice.rb - an alice chatbot plugin for rbot

About 
-----
This is a plugin for rbot, an IRC bit written in ruby, which can be found 
at http://ruby-rbot.org .

The plugin implements the www.pandorabots.com API to allow for
interaction between IRC users and an Alicebot from pandorabots.com

An Alicebot is an artificially-intelligent software agent that processes natural
language (a chatbot). Alicebots use the AI-specific XML-based programming language 
AIML, designed by Dr Richard Wallace, a notable AI researcher and creator of the 
original A.L.I.C.E. (Wikipedia, Alicebot)

Installation
-----------
Install alice like you would any other rbot plugin. 
Copy alice.rb to  <rbot directory>/data/rbot/plugins/
Then rescan or restart your rbot.

Usage
-----
By default the alice plugin is disabled. 
To enable it use "alice enable"
To disable it use "alice disable"
To see the status of alice use "alice status"

To chat with the bot use "alice <statement here>"


Pandorabots each have their own botid. The plugin is shipped with a default botid you 
can use and will be fine in most cases, however if you wish to switch the botid
you can change the alice.botid config setting.

config list alice
config get alice.botid
config set alice.botid <new botid>
